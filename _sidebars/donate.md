# Please Donate

The genocide in Darfur took place in 2003. Today the need is just as great as it has 
ever been. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese continue to live in refugee camps with 
little access to food, shelter, medicine or clean water. 

From gathering and personally delivering medical supplies to 
refugee camps in Africa, to hosting women and their children in the United States. We 
are trying to make a difference through this urgently needed work.  

Join us today and donate!
