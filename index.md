## Our goals are:

* To create a safe, culturally understanding space available for refugees from 
Darfur and other refugee communities, which is know and accessible to the 
community here in Minneapolis

* To help meet the basic needs sanitation, medical supplies, food and clothing 
for people still living in refugee camps in South Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, West 
Africa, Benin and Central Africa. 

* To act as a “stop gap” service between refugees and the already existing 
governmental and non-profit systems,  providing in-person support and helping 
refugees access resources around domestic abuse, education, social services, and
medical care.
