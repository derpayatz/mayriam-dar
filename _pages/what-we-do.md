## Donations Program

The Maryiam Dar Association receives many in-kind donations each year and works to 
distribute these to the Darfurian and other refugee communities in Minnesota and the 
United States. They have helped distribute food, clothing, school and office supplies, 
kitchen and household items, and medical supplies to an estimated 150-200 people in
Minnesota and across the United States. Munira has personally delivered medical supplies
and food to refugee camps in South Sudan, Kenya, Ethiopia, West Africa, Benin, and 
Central Africa, in addition to meeting people, doing trainings, and doing research on 
conditions and needs.

Munira delivers supplies herself in order to ensure that they are going directly to the
people and children living in the camps, who need them so desperately. 

## Domestic Violence Support

The Maryiam Dar Association has recognized a critical need to educate 
refugee families and especially women regarding their rights and resources 
if they are experiencing domestic violence. Many refugee women live in 
isolated family situations and feel completely dependent on an abusive 
partner for their and their children’s survival. Others have experienced 
rape and violence from their immigration sponsors. Even with education and 
connections to domestic violence hotlines and shelters, many women are 
afraid to leave. There is a fear of what will happen to them at a shelter, 
with little to no interpretation available and many people with
significantly different cultural norms and traditions. 

With few resources for housing, Munira has opened her own doors to many of 
these women and worked with them to understand the shelter systems, 
overcome their fear and gain support. In addition to taking in local women 
experiencing domestic violence, volunteers have personally transported 
women at their own expense across state lines to get them into Munira’s 
home and to help them access shelter services. This system is 
unsustainable, and can result in confrontations between Munira and abusers 
at her home. Munira is currently looking to create a safe space dedicated 
to these women and the work of the Maryiam Dar Association.

## Interpretation and “Emergency Hotline” Program

The Maryiam Dar Association is known across the Darfurian and Arabic-speaking refugee 
and social services community and has provided interpretation for refugees experiencing 
difficulty with social services across the United States and from as far away as Italy. 

Munira has provided free-of-cost interpretation for refugees in Washington, Oregon, 
Utah, California, Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, South Dakota, 
Nebraska, Washington D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, as well as across Minnesota and the 
Twin Cities metro area. Interpretation support has resulted in innumerable instances of 
individuals and their families receiving the medical, social services, and legal support
that they needed. 

## “Stop Gap” Services:
In addition to providing interpretation services, the Maryiam Dar Association works with
people in other ways to help them bridge the gap and get the knowledge and skills 
necessary to access services such as health care, food stamps, cash assistance and youth
programs. They work to explain government and non-profit service systems so that recent
refugees feel comfortable accessing them and have the documentation that they need. We 
work to connect people to local service agencies in their area such as food shelves, 
donation centers, clinics, schools and universities, English language courses, and 
shelters.

Transportation to these services, encouragement, and help with paperwork are all vital ways in which the Maryiam Dar Associations helps refugees to “Bridge the Gap.”

## Health Services Education:

The Maryiam Dar Association has recognized a considerable gap in the area of health 
services and education for incoming refugees. Due to the violence and trauma of their 
experience, in addition to the experience of long periods of time without basic 
necessities, many refugees are in desperate need of physical and mental health services.
Many have experienced poor or inadequate care in refugee camp hospitals; if hospitals 
and doctors were available at all, refugees in camps were very frequently turned away, 
given incorrect prescriptions and poor care and therefore do not trust hospitals and 
doctors. Due to a lack of interpreters and cultural differences in how and when to 
receive medical care, many refugees, especially female refugees, are uncomfortable 
accessing medical care in Minnesota and across the United States.

To meet this need, the Maryiam Dar Association has hosted health services orientations 
in order to offer safe spaces for people to receive health systems education and basic 
health advice, such as encouraging families to eat healthy food, brush their teeth, get
immunizations, go to the doctor, and take prescribed medication. Such events have 
connected on average 50-100 people to leading health professionals in Minnesota.

## Past events include:

* A women’s nutrition and diabetes workshop to discuss how to control diabetes, healthy
food and exercise, insulin monitoring and how to take their prescriptions, as well as
when to call Emergency Services (2011);
* A women’s cancer education workshop to encourage women to check for breast cancer,
get their mammograms, and do regular uterine cancer screening, and to follow through
with treatment (2015);
* A women’s health workshop on fibroid issues, connecting women with a doctor/surgeon
from the University of Minnesota, to discuss how and why doctors screen and do body
imaging and which treatments are available (2016);
* A monthly meeting of women suffering from mental trauma to get advice,
encouragement, information about therapy and information about basic health services
and hygiene for their families. Every two months the group would meet to do a fun
activity together, such as henna, music, makeup, braiding or traditional food. (2017).
