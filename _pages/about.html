    <h1>About Us</h1>
  </header>
  <p>The founder of the Mayriam Dar Association is Munira Mohamed, originally from 
the Darfur region in Sudan. She arrived in the United States in 1999. In 2003, 
the political and social situation in Darfur exploded. In what is now recognized
as a massive genocide, hundreds of thousands of people were displaced from their
homes and killed, including many members of the Munira’s family.</p>

<p>As refugees arrived in the United States and in Minnesota, they sought out 
Munira. Arriving with nothing, everyone needed help. Realizing that she could 
not personally assist everyone, Munira established the Maryiam Dar Association 
in 2005 and became incorporated as a non-profit in 2013 with a board and core 
group of volunteers.</p>

<p>The Maryiam Dar Association began working to connect individual refugees and 
their families with services, to assist in translation, to provide 
transportation, to create health classes, and to provide a safe space for women 
who suffered domestic violence and needed time, education, translation and other
services before they felt able to reach out to existing shelter services.</p>

<p>Recognized for its work across the United States, organizations and social 
service workers from across the country reach out to Munira and the Maryiam Dar 
Association for assistance. ​These essential services are provided by 
unpaid volunteers giving their time and their labor for the benefit of the 
community.</p>

<p>Now, the Mayriam Dar Association is working today to build their programs, 
secure more funding and volunteers, and move beyond operating out of private 
homes. Munira has a vision of a community connection center that has safe space 
specifically for refugee women experiencing domestic violence. This safe space 
is the Maryiam Dar Association’s ultimate goal.</p>
